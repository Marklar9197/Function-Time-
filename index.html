<h1> Hello My name is Brandon Goldenberg and welcome to my About Me page ! </h1>

<h4> Let me tell you a little bit about myself </h4>

<p>

I'm 24 years young and  was born and raised in Glen Head New York. I have two older siblings, one brother and one sister. My family comes from Romania and immigrated to the United States in the mid 70s. I have a bachelor's degree in Journalism from Purchase College. After graduating in 2013, I spent 5 months living in Tel Aviv working for a start up tech company. I'm currently living with my parents but am attending General Assembly to sharpen my programming skills, get more experience and training, and most importantly, make enough money to get out of my house and live on my own.
